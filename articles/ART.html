        <p> Ever wanted to create your own programming language? Me too! Now it is easier than ever thanks to a new software language engineering tool, ART. </p>
        <p>
            Ever looked at some of the documentation for popular programming languages?
            If not, go look at the Java specification. No really do it, here is a link:
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/.
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is far too verbose. This is where ART comes in. Developed by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott,
            ART (ambiguity retained translation) <a href="#ref2"> [2]</a>
            allows you to write concise and formally verifiable programming languages. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            I spoke to Adrian, who had this to say on his motivation for developing ART:
            "
            on my motivation: it's two-fold:
            (i) to provide complete, concise and thus maintainable specifications for small programming languages and
            (ii) to provide a software-engineer-friendly introduction to Structural Operational Semantics which is the most common way that theoreticians specify the meaning of programs.
            ".

        </p>
        <p>
            As the specification is very concise, it is easy for other programmers in your team to use and adapt your language. <br/>
        </p>

        <h2>
            Pros of ART versus other tools:
        </h2>
        Allows concise specifications for complex languages. Speeds up process for development of the langauge. Allows better formalisation. Easier for others to understand, maintain and add to your language.

        <p>
            The developers go into extensive detail and provide great summaries of the core principles, and as such I will not go into detail here.
            I hope this article has motivated you to check out ART, and maybe even write a language of your own! After all, it's easier now that it ever has been.
