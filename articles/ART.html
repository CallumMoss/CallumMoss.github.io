            Ever wanted to create your own programming language? Me too! Now it is easier than ever thanks to a new software language engineering tool, ART.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever looked at some of the documentation for popular programming languages?
            If not, go look at the Java specification. No really do it, here is a link:
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/.
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            No-one out there, including Java developers, know the specification of its own language, for example, how many operator priority levels are there? No one really knows. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where ART comes in. Developed by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott,
            <a href="https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                ART (ambiguity retained translation)
            </a>
            allows you to write concise and formally verifiable programming languages. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            As the specification is very concise, it is easy for other programmers in your team to use and adapt your language. <br/>
        </p>
