        <h2>
            Creating your own programming language is now easy!
        </h2>
        <p> 
            Ever wanted to create your own programming language? <br/>
            Ever looked at some of the documentation for popular programming languages? <br> If not, go look at the Java specification. No really do it, here is a link: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/. <br/>
            No-one out there, including Java developers, know the specification of its own language, for example, how many operator priority levels are there? No one really knows. <br/>

            This is where ART comes in. Developed by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott: https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART , ART (ambiguity retained translation), allows you to write concise and formally verifiable programming languages. <br/>

            As the specification is very concise, it is easy for other programmers in your team to use and adapt your language. <br/>
